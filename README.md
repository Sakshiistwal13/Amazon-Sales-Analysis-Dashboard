## Key Insights:

1)Top Month for Sales:

April 2022 shows the highest overall sales volume with categories like Blouses, Tops, and Shirts dominating.
The exact peak seems to be April 17 - 23, 2022, when the quantity sold was over 5,500 units.

2)Sales Trends by Week:

March 21 to June 26, 2022 is the period covered.
Sales volume remained relatively consistent with visible peaks, notably in mid-April and early May.
The chart shows a decrease in June, with the lowest sales occurring during the week of June 26, 2022.

3)Best-Performing Category:

Based on the Quantity by Week and Category breakdown, Blouses and Tops appear to perform consistently well across weeks.
The T-Shirts category also saw strong performance, especially in April and May.
Shipping Status:

94.21% of orders were successfully shipped, indicating a strong operational performance.
Only 5.79% were marked as unshipped, with no cancelled orders, which reflects efficient supply chain management.

4)Top Regions for Sales:

Maharashtra and Karnataka are leading the sales in terms of total quantity, with Maharashtra showing the highest number of items sold (over 20,000).
Other states such as Tamil Nadu and Telangana also show strong sales figures.

5)Shipping Speed Breakdown:

Standard shipping is more common, with around 11,747 orders compared to expedited shipping, which accounted for 5,538 orders.
Expedited shipping was most popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

6)Best-Selling Sizes:

Medium (M) and Large (L) sizes show the highest quantity sold, making them the dominant sizes in terms of demand.
Smaller sizes such as XS and S have lower sales, suggesting a potential inventory optimization opportunity.

7)Sales Channel Performance:

99.86% of sales occurred through Amazon.in, with B2B sales constituting a small fraction (0.72%), indicating a high reliance on Amazon's core consumer market.

8)Revenue Analysis:

The line chart tracking Revenue by Week and Category shows a peak in revenue during April 10 - 16, 2022, with nearly ₹4 million in sales.
The revenue tends to decline gradually towards the end of June, indicating the need to assess why demand tapered off.


 Key KPIs:

Total Quantity Sold: 116,649 units
Total Revenue: ₹78.59M
Total Categories: 9
Total Products: 7,190
Total Shipping Success Rate: 94.21%

## Potential Business Actions Based on Insights:

Restock Key Sizes and Categories:

1)Focus on restocking Medium and Large sizes, as they consistently drive sales.
Popular categories like Blouses and Tops should be given priority in inventory management.
Investigate June Sales Decline:

2)June showed a visible drop in sales. This could indicate either a seasonal trend or a potential issue with stock, promotions, or delivery efficiency.
Shipping Optimization:

3)With a majority of sales relying on standard shipping, introducing promotions or better pricing for expedited shipping in top-performing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka could increase customer satisfaction and potentially drive more revenue.
State-Specific Promotions:

4)With Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu leading in sales, targeted promotions or marketing campaigns could further enhance revenue in these high-performing regions.


## Conclusion

This Tableau dashboard showcases how KPI-driven data visualization can transform raw data into actionable insights on sales trends, shipping performance, and customer preferences, enhancing business decision-making in e-commerce.
