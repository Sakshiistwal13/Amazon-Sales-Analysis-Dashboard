📊 Weekly & Category Trends: Visual breakdowns of sales by week and category reveal fluctuations in sales volume, helping identify peak periods and top-selling categories. Items like blouses saw consistent sales, especially during specific weeks.

🚚 Shipping Status Analysis: The dashboard highlights shipping statuses, with 78K items shipped, and only 5.79% unshipped or pending. This includes insights into expedited vs. standard shipping, ensuring operational efficiency is clearly monitored.

🌍 Regional Performance Insights: A map visualization and top 10 states list reveal regional trends, with Maharashtra and Karnataka leading in sales, providing a clear understanding of state-level performance and demand hotspots.

📦 Size and Category Metrics: The dashboard also breaks down quantity by size, showing that M and L sizes dominate sales, offering insights to fine-tune inventory management and future stock planning.
